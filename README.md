**Fraud Detection System - KTC** üí≥üîç

This project implements a robust Fraud Detection System for financial transactions using machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. By analyzing transaction patterns and leveraging advanced models, the system ensures high accuracy and provides actionable insights for financial security.

üìö **Overview**
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions pose a significant risk to businesses and customers. This project addresses this challenge using a supervised learning approach, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced machine learning models, and evaluation metrics to build an effective fraud detection system.

üîë **Key Features**

1. Dataset Analysis and Insights
Dataset: The project uses the dataset PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv, containing anonymized financial transaction data with the following attributes:

Transaction Type: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER.
Transaction Amount: Numeric values for transaction amounts.
Account Information: Includes nameOrig and nameDest (origin and destination accounts).
Fraud Indicators: Flags for fraud (isFraud) and suspicious transactions (isFlaggedFraud).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of transaction types.
Fraud-to-non-fraud ratio.
Transaction patterns by type and fraud indicators.

2. Data Preprocessing
Verified dataset integrity by checking for null values.
Engineered features to analyze fraud-related patterns, including grouping transactions by type and identifying flagged frauds.
Addressed class imbalance to ensure effective model training.

4. Machine Learning Modeling
Implemented XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), a powerful and efficient gradient-boosting algorithm, for fraud detection.
Additionally explored Logistic Regression for baseline comparisons.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio.

6. Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy Score: Assesses overall correctness of the model.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Evaluates performance in fraud classification.
AUC-ROC Curve: Highlights the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

7. Results and Insights
XGBoost outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving better precision and recall while minimizing false positives.
Highlighted key transaction features that contribute to fraud detection.
Explored patterns in flagged fraud transactions to improve detection accuracy.
